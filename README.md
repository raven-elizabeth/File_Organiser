# File Organiser (Windows)
A Python program to organise your downloads folder by file type.
Currently only available for Windows operating systems, this project is a work in progress.

### Next Steps:
- Organisation for screenshots folder
- Cross-platform functionality (difficult to test as I only have a Windows device)
- Automation
- Improved code design
