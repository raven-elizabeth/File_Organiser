# File Organiser (Windows)
A Python program to organise your downloads folder by file type.
Currently only available for Windows operating systems, it can be automated using Windows Task Scheduler.
In the current state, this program assumes your downloads folder will be in the location: `C:\Users\[Username]\Downloads`

This project is a work in progress, but it is not updated regularly due to other commitments.

### Next Steps:
- Cross-platform functionality including automation (difficult to test as I only have a Windows device)
- Improved code design
- Organisation for screenshots folder
